# Lyrics generation using deep learning

## Datasets used

All datasets are publicly available and were sources via Kaggle. They weren’t uploaded due to the Github’s file size limit.

## Models explored

Char-based LSTM, word-level encoder-decoder RNNs, LeakGAN, fine-tuned GPT-2.

## Sample of generated lyrics

Text generated by the fine-tuned GPT-2 model. Prompt in bold.

**nlp course was a really big hit**\
**now we here hitting you with this crazy beat**\
**gpt two spitting fire we lit**\
ima hit you\
with the lightnin' in your eyes\
you're a fly through the sky so fast\
never thought that it really would last\
but i'm ready to fly

i'm the voice of the darkness\
the one who sees the shadows fallin'\
with no room for a heart\
that's a little too loud\
my head is stuck in the clouds

and the world is in the flames\
leave my footprints in the sand\
like a child at the river\
i hear the sound of the music\
and you're about to drown in waves\
there is a reason to believe in something\
that can take the wind away\
there is no way of knowing what's next to the sky\
when the sun is coming up it's hard to find\
it's hard to feel\
it's hard\
this is crazy...

we’ve been in love for too long\
the more things change\
the less you want to know\
we are gone\
and we've gone insane\
our hearts are made of glass and chains\
and no one knows\
what happened when we spoke to strangers\
when we walked right through the door\
i can't believe we've met

let’s have some fun again\
but we find it strange\
i don't think it’s fair to say\
we were wrong for losing our minds\
we had lost our way\
and now we're not as different as before\
how we got here\
no matter what we do\
it’s a long way\
this is crazy
